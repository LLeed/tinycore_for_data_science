# Tiny Core for Data Science

## Introduction
  The propose of this project is to make available the modificate version of Tiny Core's iso, a minimalistic linux distribution (distro), with the basic programs for data analysis. Theses "programs" are: Gretl and R, properly a programming language, (with RStudio).
  The motivation for this project is share a linux distribution with focus on low power machines. This is achived given the Tiny Core's nature (the minimum requirements: Pentium 2 or better, 128mb of ram + some swap; some for the interface version)ยน, what leave the machine with some free resorces for analysis.
  
## Some Questions  
  Difficulties are parallel with the strongess of this distribution, the main problem is the low automation for installing software dependencies and your idiocincratics packages(in .tcz extension). The two factors cause some problems for installing the above mentioned programs, it been necessary to use the source code and install there respected dependencies one by one.
  The chose of the "programs" (Gretl and R) is based in two factors. First, both are free software. Furthermore, the Gretl is a reference for first steps in econometric analises and R is foqued in a most general propose, for more "enabled users".
  
## Project
  The finality don't only give a modded iso, but also present the steps related the installation and any tricks for facility use the distro, for new users in Linux or high-end Linux users.
  So, the project's characterized in one hand like a tutorial and the other hand delivery a plug-and-play solution for data analise.
